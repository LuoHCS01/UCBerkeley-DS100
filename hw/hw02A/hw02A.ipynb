It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Benford’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law), also known as the Law of Anomalous Numbers or the First Digit Law, is a phenomenon seen in many real-world datasets. In datasets where Benford’s Law applies, there is an overrepresentation of small numbers (e.g., 1 and 2) in the leading digits of numeric entries and an underrepresentation of large numbers (e.g., 8 and 9). Benford’s Law is observed in river lengths, national populations, and has even been used to investigate [financial fraud](https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=what-is-benfords-law-and-why-fraud-examiners-use-it)! More about Benford’s Law can be found [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-benfords-law-why-this-unexpected-pattern-of-numbers-is-everywhere/).\n",
